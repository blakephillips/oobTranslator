# oobTranslator
An amusing little application that translates sentences into funny sentences by changing the vowels to 'oob'.

Uses Visual Studio 2019. 

Here is an example of 'Hello how is it going?' translated (or oobified). 

'Hooblloob hoobw oobs oobt gooboobng?' 
Yes, this is a completely useless application.
